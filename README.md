# Simon says
- This is a simple computer version of the the game we all have played using JQuery, HTML, and CSS.
- My approach was to create the board, with design and the colored circles first. The logic and all of the Jquery came last.

# How to play
- Here are the steps you should take:
	- Step 1: Click start and wait for the first color to show.
	- Step 2: Select the same exact color that the computer chose by clicking on the right circle.
	- Step 3: If user gets it correct, the computer will add an additional color to the existing sequence.
	- Step 4: Keep selecting the same exact colors as the computer.
	- Step 5: If user gets incorrect sequence, he or she will be notified and the game will reset. The reset button also restarts the game.

# Unsolved problem
- The current unsolved problem of this game is when the same color is randomly picked twice in a row. In this situation, the color just stays bright for double the time, instead of adding a class then removing it like it happens when the colors are different.
